## Features

* **Safe Locale-Aware Case Conversion:** Provides `safeToLowerCase` and `safeToUppercase` functions that attempt to use locale-specific case conversion via `toLocaleLowerCase` and `toLocaleUpperCase`. Includes a robust fallback to standard `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase` to ensure consistent behavior across different environments. Allows for optional locale parameters to handle language-specific case conversion rules.
* **Intelligent Slugification:** Offers a `slugify` function that converts strings into URL-friendly slugs; removes diacritics, special characters, and replaces spaces with hyphens. Attempts to preserve file extensions during slugification, intelligently differentiating between file extensions and other dot-separated text.
* **Base64 Encoding/Decoding:** Implements `base64Encode` and `base64Decode` functions for seamless Base64 encoding and decoding of strings.
* **URL Encoding/Decoding:** Provides `urlEncode` and `urlDecode` functions for encoding and decoding strings for use in URLs.
* **GUID Generation:** Generates Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) with the following formatting options:
    * **Raw format:** `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (e.g., `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6`)
    * **Registry format:** `{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}` (e.g., `{a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6}`)
    * **Square brackets format:** `[Guid("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")]` (e.g., `[Guid("a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6")]`)
    * **Less than sign format:** `<Guid("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")>` (e.g., `<Guid("a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6")>`)
* **Remove Empty Lines:** Provides functionality to remove empty lines from text with the following options:
    * When true, removes all empty lines.
    * When false, only removes consecutive empty lines, keeping single empty lines intact.
    * Considers lines with only whitespace (spaces, tabs) as empty when true.
    * Only removes completely empty lines when false.
* **Remove Non-Printable Characters:** Removes characters that are not typically intended for printing or display.
* **Remove Leading and Trailing Whitespace:** Trims whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the beginning and end of strings.
* **Named HTML Entities:** Converts applicable characters to their corresponding named HTML entity representation (e.g., `<>` to `&lt;&gt;`, `√©` to `&eacute;`) and reverses the process, transforming named HTML entities back into their original character form (e.g., `&quot;` to `"`).
* **HTML Hex Entities:** Encodes characters using their hexadecimal Unicode code point representation in the HTML entity format (e.g., `!√ºüî•` to `&#x21;&#xFC;&#x1F525;`) and interprets/converts HTML hexadecimal entities back to their original characters (e.g., `&#x41;` to `A`).
* **HTML Decimal Entities:** Encodes characters using their decimal Unicode code point representation in the HTML entity format (e.g., `"√†üëç` to `&#34;&#224;&#128077;`) and converts HTML decimal entities back to their corresponding characters (e.g., `&#97;` to `a`).
* **JavaScript Unicode Escape Sequences:** Transforms characters into their JavaScript-style Unicode escape sequence representation (e.g., `\uXXXX` or `\UXXXXXXXX`, like `$√±‚ú®` to `$\u00F1\u2728`) and parses/converts these escape sequences back to their original characters (e.g., `\u00E9` to `√©`).
* **CSS Unicode Escape Sequences:** Encodes characters into the format used within CSS (e.g., `\XXXXXX`, like `#√¥‚ù§Ô∏è` to `#\00F4 \2764 \FE0F `) and interprets/converts these escape sequences back to their original characters (e.g., `\0042` to `B`).
* **Unicode Code Points:** Represents characters using the standard Unicode code point notation (e.g., `U+XXXX`, like `%√ßü§î` to `U+0025 U+00E7 U+1F914`) and converts strings in this format back to their corresponding Unicode characters (e.g., `U+0043` to `C`).
* **ES6 Unicode Code Point Escape Sequences:** Encodes characters using the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) specific format (e.g., `\u{XXXXXX}`, like `&√°üöÄ` to `&\u{E1}\u{1F680}`) and parses/converts these escape sequences back to their original characters (e.g., `\u{61}` to `a`).
* **Extended Hex Escape Sequences:** Encodes characters using extended hexadecimal escape sequences (e.g., `\x{XXXXXX}`, like `'√•üòÇ` to `\x{E5}\x{1F602}`) and converts these escape sequences back to their corresponding characters (e.g., `\x{44}` to `D`).
* **Hex Code Points:** Represents characters using their hexadecimal code point value (e.g., `0xXXXX`, like `(√®üéâ` to `0x28 0xE8 0x1F389`) and converts these hexadecimal code point strings back to their corresponding characters (e.g., `0x65` to `e`).
* **Multi-Language Support**: The extension's user interface and informational messages are available in English (en), Magyar (hu), Slovenƒçina (sk), ƒåe≈°tina (cs), Deutsch (de), Fran√ßais (fr), Polski (pl), –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ (bg), Espa√±ol (es), Italiano (it), Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (ja), ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ (ko), Portugu√™s do Brasil (pt-br), –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (ru), T√ºrk√ße (tr), ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá (zh-cn), ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá (zh-tw) languages.

## Requirements

This extension has no special requirements or dependencies. It works directly within Visual Studio Code.

## Known Issues

* **Locale-Specific Case Conversion Inconsistencies:**
    * The `safeToLowerCase` and `safeToUppercase` functions rely on `toLocaleLowerCase` and `toLocaleUpperCase`, respectively, which can exhibit inconsistencies across different JavaScript environments and operating systems. This can lead to unexpected results when converting text with locale-specific rules.
    * While a fallback to `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase` is implemented, this fallback might not provide the desired locale-specific behavior, potentially resulting in incorrect case conversions for certain languages.
    * When using locale parameters, it is possible that some environments do not contain the locale data, causing the function to fail.

* **Slugification Limitations with Complex File Names:**
    * The `slugify` function attempts to preserve file extensions but might not handle all edge cases correctly. For instance, file names with multiple dots or unusual extension patterns could lead to unintended slugification outcomes.
    * The function's reliance on regular expressions for character removal and replacement might not cover all possible non-alphanumeric characters, potentially leaving some unwanted characters in the slugified output.

* **GUID Generation Predictability:**
    * The `generateGuid` function uses `Math.random()` for GUID generation, which is not cryptographically secure. While suitable for most general-purpose use cases, it should not be used for applications requiring high levels of security or uniqueness.
    * While the GUID generated is very unlikely to be the same, there is still a very small risk of collision.

If you encounter any of these or other issues, please report them on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/playfulsparkle/vscode_ps_dev_toolbox/issues) with detailed steps to reproduce the problem.
