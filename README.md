* **Text formatting**
  * Text case conversion commands. Easily convert selected text into various common programming case formats:
    * **Camel case.** Lowercase first word, uppercase subsequent words. Example: `myVariableName`.
    * **Pascal case.** Each word starts with an uppercase letter. Example: `MyClassName`.
    * **Snake case.** Words separated by underscores, all lowercase. Example: `my_variable_name`.
    * **Screaming snake case.** Words separated by underscores, all uppercase. Example: `MY_CONSTANT_NAME`.
    * **Kebab case.** Words separated by hyphens, all lowercase. Example: `my-variable-name`.
    * **Train case.** Words separated by hyphens, all uppercase. Example: `MY-VARIABLE-NAME`.
    * **Flat case.** All words joined without separators, all lowercase. Example: `myvariablename`.
    * **Uppercase.** All characters uppercase without separators. Example: `MYVARIABLENAME`.
  * **Locale aware case conversion.** Provides local aware functions that use locale specific case conversion via `toLocaleLowerCase` and `toLocaleUpperCase`. Includes a fallback to standard `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase` to ensure consistent behavior across different environments. Allows optional locale parameters to handle language specific case conversion rules.
* **Utilities**
  * **Slugify text** (make text URL safe). Offers a `slugify` function that converts strings into URL friendly slugs, removes diacritics, special characters, and replaces spaces with hyphens. Attempts to preserve file extensions during slugification, intelligently differentiating between file extensions and other dot separated text.
  * **GUID generation.** Generates Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) with the following formatting options:
    * _Raw format:_ `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (example: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6`).
    * _Registry format:_ `{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}` (example: `{a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6}`).
    * _Square brackets format:_ `[Guid("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")]` (example: `[Guid("a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6")]`).
    * _Less than sign format:_ `<Guid("xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx")>` (example: `<Guid("a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-9abc-c1d2e3f4a5b6")>`).
  * **Remove empty lines.** Provides functionality to remove empty lines from text with the following options:
    * When true, removes all empty lines.
    * When false, only removes consecutive empty lines, keeping single empty lines intact.
    * Considers lines with only whitespace (spaces, tabs) as empty when true.
    * Only removes completely empty lines when false.
  * Remove non printable characters. Removes characters that are not typically intended for printing or display.
  * **Remove leading and trailing whitespace.** Trims whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) from the beginning and end of strings.
* **Encoding and conversions**
  * **Base64 encoding/decoding.** Implements `base64Encode` and `base64Decode` functions for seamless Base64 encoding and decoding of strings.
  * **URL encoding/decoding.** Provides `urlEncode` and `urlDecode` functions for encoding and decoding strings for use in URLs.
  * **Named HTML entities.** Convert characters to named entities and back. Format: `&name;`. Examples: `é` to `&eacute;`, `<` to `&lt;`, `"` to `&quot;`.
  * **HTML hexadecimal character reference**. Use hex numeric entities for any code point. Format: `&#xXXXX;`, `&#xXXXXXX;`. Examples: `é` to `&#x00E9;`, `🔥` to `&#x1F525;`.
  * **HTML decimal character reference.** Use decimal numeric entities for any code point. Format: `&#XXX;`, `&#XXXXXX;`. Examples: `é` to `&#233;`, `🔥` to `&#128293;`.
  * **JavaScript UTF-16 escape sequences.** Encode as UTF 16 units for JS strings, supports surrogate pairs. Format: `\XXXX`, `\XXXXXX` (pair shown as two `\XXXX`). Examples: `é` to `\u00E9`, `🔥` to `\uD83D\uDD25`.
  * **CSS Unicode escape sequences.** Encode for CSS strings and identifiers, allows optional trailing space. Format: `\XXXX`, `\XXXXXX`. Examples: `é` to `\00E9`, `🔥` to `\1F525`.
  * **Unicode code point notation.** Represent characters as code points for docs and debugging. Format: `U+XXXX`, `U+XXXXX`. Examples: `é` to `U+00E9`, `🔥` to `U+1F525`.
  * **Unicode code point escape sequence.** Encode code points for modern JS. Format: `\u{XX}`, `\u{XXXXX}`. Examples: `é` to `\u{00E9}`, `🔥` to `\u{1F525}`.
  * **PCRE Unicode hexadecimal escapes.** Encode for PCRE compatible regex engines. Format: `\x{XX}`, `\x{XXXXX}`. Examples: `é` to `\x{00E9}`, `🔥` to `\x{1F525}`.
  * **Hex code points.** Show code points with `0x` prefix, useful for debugging. Format: `0xXX`, `0xXXXXX`. Examples: `é` to `0x00E9`, `🔥` to `0x1F525`.
* **Multi-Language Support**: The extension's user interface and informational messages are available in English (en), Magyar (hu), Slovenčina (sk), Čeština (cs), Deutsch (de), Français (fr), Polski (pl), Български (bg), Español (es), Italiano (it), 日本語 (ja), 한국어 (ko), Português do Brasil (pt-br), Русский (ru), Türkçe (tr), 简体中文 (zh-cn), 繁體中文 (zh-tw) languages.

## Requirements

This extension has no special requirements or dependencies. It works directly within Visual Studio Code.

## Known Issues

* **Locale-Specific Case Conversion Inconsistencies:**
    * The `safeToLowerCase` and `safeToUppercase` functions rely on `toLocaleLowerCase` and `toLocaleUpperCase`, respectively, which can exhibit inconsistencies across different JavaScript environments and operating systems. This can lead to unexpected results when converting text with locale-specific rules.
    * While a fallback to `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase` is implemented, this fallback might not provide the desired locale-specific behavior, potentially resulting in incorrect case conversions for certain languages.
    * When using locale parameters, it is possible that some environments do not contain the locale data, causing the function to fail.

* **Slugification Limitations with Complex File Names:**
    * The `slugify` function attempts to preserve file extensions but might not handle all edge cases correctly. For instance, file names with multiple dots or unusual extension patterns could lead to unintended slugification outcomes.
    * The function's reliance on regular expressions for character removal and replacement might not cover all possible non-alphanumeric characters, potentially leaving some unwanted characters in the slugified output.

* **GUID Generation Predictability:**
    * The `generateGuid` function uses `Math.random()` for GUID generation, which is not cryptographically secure. While suitable for most general-purpose use cases, it should not be used for applications requiring high levels of security or uniqueness.
    * While the GUID generated is very unlikely to be the same, there is still a very small risk of collision.

### 0.0.10

* Updated the logic for removing non-printable characters. Most control characters and specific invisible whitespace are now replaced with a space. Standard whitespace (tab, line feed, carriage return) is preserved, as are zero-width joiners/non-joiners and variation selectors when they are part of character sequences.

### 0.0.9

* Introduced a suite of commands to easily convert selected text to various common programming case formats like `camelCase` (e.g., `myVariableName`), `PascalCase` (e.g., `MyClassName`), `snake_case` (e.g., `my_variable_name`), `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT_NAME`), `kebab-case` (e.g., `my-variable-name`), `TRAIN-CASE` (e.g., `MY-VARIABLE-NAME`), `flatcase` (e.g., `myvariablename`), `UPPERCASE` (e.g., `MYVARIABLENAME`)
